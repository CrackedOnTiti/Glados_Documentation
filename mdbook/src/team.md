## Core Contributors

### Thierry B.
**Role:** Compiler & Virtual Machine

**Contributions:**
- Project architecture and design
- Complete compiler implementation
- Virtual machine design and execution engine
- Build system setup and configuration
- Technical documentation

Thierry designed and implemented the core compilation pipeline, from IR generation to bytecode execution. He established the project structure and build tooling that enabled efficient team collaboration.

### Aymeric L.
**Role:** Parser, Security & Bonus Features

**Contributions:**
- Full modular parsing system
- Advanced security and type checking
- Bonus feature implementation
- Compiler refactoring and modularization

Aymeric built the complete parsing infrastructure using Megaparsec, implementing the full language grammar with proper error handling. He designed and implemented the comprehensive security layer including type checking, initialization tracking, and return path analysis. Additionally, he refactored the compiler to eliminate illegal imports and improve modularity.
