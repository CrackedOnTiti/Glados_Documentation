Welcome to the GLaDOS programming language documentation!

## What is GLaDOS?

GLaDOS (Generic Language and Data Operand Syntax) is a statically-typed, compiled programming language that emphasizes safety and performance. It features:

- **Static type checking** - Catch errors before runtime
- **C-like syntax** - Familiar and easy to learn
- **Bytecode compilation** - Efficient execution
- **Stack-based VM** - Fast and predictable

## Quick Example

```c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int result = factorial(5);
    return result;
}
```

## Project Goals

GLaDOS aims to recreate HolyC (the programming language created by Terry A. Davis for TempleOS) with our own fun twists. While maintaining the spirit of a simple, powerful systems language, we've added modern safety features and improvements.

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Haskell** | GHC 9.6.3 | Implementation language |
| **Stack** | LTS 22.6 | Build system |
| **Megaparsec** | Latest | Parser library |
| **Hspec** | â‰¥ 2.7.0 | Testing framework |
| **Binary** | Latest | Bytecode serialization |

### Why Haskell?

Haskell's strong type system and functional programming paradigms make it an excellent choice for building compilers and type checkers. The language naturally lends itself to writing correct, maintainable compiler infrastructure. That said, the choice of Haskell was also imposed by our school, EPITECH, as part of the curriculum requirements for this project.
